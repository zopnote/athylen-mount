Unifying application for efficient and C-dependent 
program development. It supports windows, linux, android, 
macOS and iOS as targets.

Cmount is a debug and builder application 
to make the developers life easier. It provides a 
standardized project structure, dependency management 
and hot reload for all supported languages in the 
development cycle through a llvm just in time compiler.

Cmount supports out of the box Dart, Python and of course C. 
The application can be easily extended through extension bundles.
The code is participated in libraries you can use individually 
from inside your C code. For example, only the C LLVM JIT 
or the parser.
